# Web Dev Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal web development playground!  
This repo is where I learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—one step at a time.

## 🌱 About This Repo
This is a collection of small projects, experiments, and notes as I explore:
- HTML structure and semantics
- Styling with CSS
- Interactivity using JavaScript

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Web page layouts
- Forms and inputs
- Flexbox & Grid
- DOM manipulation
- Basic animations

## 📁 Project Structure
Each folder contains a mini project or concept I'm practicing.

## 🔄 Still Learning!
This repo will keep evolving as I learn more.  
Feel free to explore—or just ignore, it's mostly for me 😄
